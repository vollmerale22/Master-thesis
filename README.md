# Description
The code is applied in my Master thesis "Nowcasting trade areas using machine learning methods". It closely follows Chinn, M. D., Meunier, B., Stumpner, S. (2023). "Nowcasting World Trade with Machine Learning: a Three-Step Approach", NBER Working Paper, No 31419, National Bureau of Economic Research and partly uses the code.
