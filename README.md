# Description
The code is applied in my Master thesis "Nowcasting trade areas using machine learning methods". It closely follows Chinn, M. D., Meunier, B., Stumpner, S. (2023). "Nowcasting World Trade with Machine Learning: a Three-Step Approach", NBER Working Paper, No 31419, National Bureau of Economic Research and partly uses the code.

# Machine learning methods
The following methods are used:

- Macroeconomic random forest as: Goulet-Coulombe, P. (2020). “The Macroeconomy as a Random Forest”, arXiv pre-print
- (Linear) gradient boosting as: Chen, T., and Guestrin, C. (2016). “XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System”, in Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 785–794
- Random Forests
- Long Short Term Memory

# Statistical Methods

The following statistical methods are used: 
- Markov-Switching
- AutoRegressive Model
- Quantile Regression
- OLS

# Pre Processing Methods
- Least Angle Regression (LARS) as: Efron, B., Hastie, T., Johnstone, I., and Tibshirani, R. (2004). “Least angle regression”, Annals of Statistics, 32(2), pp. 407–499
